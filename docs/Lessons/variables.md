<h1>Chapter 2: Variables</h1>

In this chapter, we'll be covering how to create and use variables. For a quick reference, <a href="../Essentials/variables">click here</a>.

Variables are used to store data. This can be numbers, letters, words, and much more. This allows you to update values when your program is running.
To use a variable, we need to declare it, and initialise it.

Declaring a variable means creating it.
This is done in the format of "Type name;", where type is the datatype of the variable, and name is the name you are giving to the variable. An example of declaring some of the datatypes you'll use most frequently are given below:

{% highlight java %}
int wholeNumber;
float decimalNumber;
boolean trueOrFalse;
{% endhighlight %}
