<h1>Introduction</h1>
This course acts as a refresher and entry level programme for the essentials you'll need when working through the basics of programming. We'll be making use of the Processing development environment, writing Java code, and creating a Snake game to get used to using all of the essentials.


Each chapter can be completed on its own, but each will make use of material from the previous chapters, so make sure to go back if you're unsure how anything's been done!
